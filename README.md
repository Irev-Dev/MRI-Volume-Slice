# MRI Volume Slice

A 3 axis viewer or 3d volumes right in the broswer. Currently supports loading in Nifti (.nii) files. When you click and drag on any of the 3 axis, the other two axis update to display a slice at the coordinates of the mouse.

This kind of three axis viewer is common in neuro science, but in the spirit of accessibility, open-source and open-science; here is an open-source viewer on the universal platform (the web browser).

At the moment this is very much a hobby project of mine, so you can expect bugs. Feel free to contact me.
